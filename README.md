We've covered quite a bit of information in a very short amount of time, so let's quickly review. User storage is an important part of a successful app, and there are a ton of options, so it's important to understand what makes sense for your particular use case. To help with that, I introduced the storage decision framework to help you determine which option is best suited for your needs. The first storage method that we examined was user data. The two forms of this are structured, such a SQLite or Room, and unstructured, such as shared preferences. 

Next, we tackled how to store user files and all of the different options that are available. We also looked at the impact of the new scoped storage approach unveiled by Google. We wrapped up the course by sharing files we created to other apps, as well as retrieving files from other apps and pulling them into our own. I hope that you found the content valuable and that you're confident in your ability to leverage user storage in your future work. If you have any questions or comments, please reach out in the course discussion below. Thanks again, and be on the lookout for other Android topic that I'll be publishing in the future.
